# Art & Biro Recreated

This is my attempt at recreating the artandbirocomic.com site using Vue 3
and TypeScript.

## Problems

Dev-tooling artandbirocomic.com rises a lot of issues relating to performance
and some level of compatibility from mobile devices since it was generated via Divi, a WordPress
site builder -- hence the `wp-content` seen on some image and some CSS links.
